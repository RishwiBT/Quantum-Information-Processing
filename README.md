# Quantum-Information-Processing
This repository consists my notes of Quantum Information processing graduate level course. It includes Handwritten notes, solutions to Nielsen &amp; Chuang exercises, and more. I want to give credit and thank my professor, Dr. Todd Brun, who taught me this course. Star the repo if you find it useful.
